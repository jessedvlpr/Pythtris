# Initial README for Pythtris

To successfully run the code, make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine --

To install Python go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download it (this code uses Python 3.10)

To install Pygame, you must have Python installed, then in Windows Command Prompt, type 'pip install Pygame' and it should guide you through the installation process, if not install it immediately.

The code should then compile successfully, enjoy Pythtris!
